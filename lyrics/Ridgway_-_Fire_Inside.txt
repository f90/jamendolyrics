i got a lot on my mind

and all of the time

been trying to do right

i may have the lost the light

but i'm keeping it tight

never give up the fight no



when my life is a wreck when my life is a wreck

have to keep it all in check keep it all in check



even in the darkest days

got a trail to blaze

gonna stick to my ways

i used to be caught in a phase

where life was a maze

until i saw the suns rays



when your life is a wreck life is a wreck

you got to take that first step



whoa oh oh oh oh

paddle on through the waves now

whoa oh oh oh oh

gonna take me to that place

whoa oh oh oh oh

find that fire inside

whoa oh oh oh oh

it's a fate that you decide



when i feel like i'm losing control

gotta reach within my soul

and if you're ever feeling low yeah

take that first step and go yeah

take that first step to the right

got to find what's inside

before we run of time run out of time run out of time



whoa oh oh oh oh

paddle on through the waves now

whoa oh oh oh oh

gonna take me to that place

whoa oh oh oh oh

find that fire inside

whoa oh oh oh oh

it's a fate that you decide

that you decide



whoa oh oh oh oh

i'm paddling on i'm paddling strong

whoa oh oh oh oh

find that fire find that fire

whoa oh oh oh oh

i'm paddling on i'm paddling strong

whoa oh oh oh oh

find that fire find that fire

find that fire find that fire find that fire
find that fire
