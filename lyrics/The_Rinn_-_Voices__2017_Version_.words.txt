the
sun
is
fading
under
blood
red
sky
the
reign
of
day
is
over
night
soon
will
break
free
they
wake
in
the
eerie
glow
of
moonlight
forgotten
souls
beyond
our
sight
world
that's
gone
forever
long
ago
lost
in
their
eyes
that
shine
with
mystery
last
remaining
shadows
of
lost
time
whisper
in
the
moonlight
surprised
you're
waking
in
the
morning
can't
understand
your
feelings
and
where
d'you
get
these
thoughts
inside
your
mind
the
voice
is
calling
for
the
night
to
rise
at
your
side
world
that's
gone
forever
long
ago
lost
in
their
eyes
that
shine
with
mystery
last
remaining
shadows
of
lost
time
whisper
in
the
moonlight
so
hear
their
voice
sharing
their
yearning
gift
they're
giving
to
you
hear
their
voice
sharing
their
memories
sacred
secrets
from
past
time
