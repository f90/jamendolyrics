i'm
asleep
at
the
wheel
and
there's
a
curve
in
the
highway
yet
we
tear
through
the
night
like
a
peyote
migraine
how
much
further
is
it
aching
so
exquisite
i
hope
we
can
stop
in
time
now
you
don't
want
to
dance
'cause
we're
looking
right
through
you
oh
oh
and
the
clothes
that
you
wear
we
don't
mean
to
stare
now
the
sky
is
on
fire
and
the
desert
is
freezing
wonder
how
i'm
alive
hen
i'm
not
even
breathing
how
much
further
is
it
aching
so
exquisite
i
hope
we
can
stop
in
time
now
you
don't
want
to
dance
'cause
we're
looking
right
through
you
oh
oh
and
the
clothes
that
you
wear
we
don't
mean
to
stare
oh
oh
but
the
people
you
know
they
say
what
they
want
to
oh
oh
'cause
the
truth
of
it
is
we
don't
really
care
