tears are like diamonds in my eyes
blind me so now you're out of sight
it's enough it's too late to break this silence

in a rose coloured view of us
either cause could i realize
all your lies would be blades to knifes
to stab me inside

who will save you from this dark
who will fix your selfish heart

a one way street that's how you live
why do you always take and never give

wide awake yeah i've crossed the line
i'm coming home
i'm running back to real life
through the start
where i could breathin' freely baby

can't you see we ran off time
chasing happiness while you get what you need

there's nothing left of us but bleeding blades and knifes
tonight you'll know how it feels

a one way street that's how you live
why do you always take and never give
i'll walk away to help you see
our love is rolling down so easily
a one way street

a one way street
you never give
i'll walk away
so easily
a one way street
