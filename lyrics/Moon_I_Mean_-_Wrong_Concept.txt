maybe you hate me
but you dress somebody's suit
because there's no risk
to put on a mask
when we get scared to live
with our back with our back

maybe you love me
but you run under the sun and me under the rain
it's so easy
to lose ourselves
when we get scared to love
with every tear with every fear

but you could give me just your money
but i wished just your honey
i burnt your t shirt that one with bunny
and now about you nothing more of funny

maybe we'll meet again
but this not the right life for us
it's so hard
to live our love
when we get scared to see
inside our soul inside our soul

but you could give me just your money
but i wished just your honey
i burnt your t shirt that one with bunny
and now about you nothing more of funny

your mind is closed like an aquarium
mine completly opened like the colosseum
so nothing about idyll between us
it's not a wrong accent no no no no no no no no
what's wrong is the concept
wrong concept to love

but you could give me just your money
but i wished just your honey
i burnt your t shirt that one with bunny
and now about you nothing more of funny
you could give me just your money
but i wished just your honey
i burnt your t shirt that one with bunny
and now about you nothing more of funny
wrong concept wrong concept to love
wrong concept to love to love wrong concept
