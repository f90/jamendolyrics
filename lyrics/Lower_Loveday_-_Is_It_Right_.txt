late nights staying up messaging you
can i express what i'm feeling for you without revealing truths

i've been thinking about you lately lately
that's a massive understatement baby
i can't stop thinking about you all day and all night
but is it right

mr dream won't become a reality but was it meant to be

i've been thinking about you lately lately
that's a massive understatement baby
cause i think about you all day and all night
but is it right

i don't know but i i know how it feels to me
maybe you're just playing games a game i don't wanna play
