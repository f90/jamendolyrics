someday
you'll
come
back
here
and
you'll
open
up
your
arms
you'll
laugh
and
say
i
knew
it
wouldn't
take
you
long
to
realize
i
was
gone
it's
only
been
three
years
but
for
me
it's
been
so
long
i
remember
it
like
yesterday
oh
you
could
say
i've
been
holding
on
i've
waited
all
of
my
life
for
you
to
make
it
right
but
the
time
has
come
and
gone
it's
faded
and
lost
all
it's
light
a
star
that
shined
so
bright
falls
from
the
sky
don't
make
a
wish
that
won't
come
true
i
learned
that
from
you
such
a
long
time
ago
when
you
left
you
said
you
had
to
find
a
better
way
of
life
this
one
just
wouldn't
do
i've
waited
all
of
my
life
for
you
to
take
your
time
to
find
your
place
but
i
learned
that
this
world
still
turns
without
you
and
you
were
just
a
phase
and
i
learned
without
you
here
i
was
happier
alone
then
i
ever
would've
known
i've
waited
i've
waited
i've
waited
i've
waited
i've
waited
i've
waited
all
of
my
my
life
for
you
to
take
your
time
but
the
time
has
come
and
gone
it's
faded
and
lost
all
it's
light
a
star
that
shined
so
bright
falls
from
the
sky
on
this
cold
december
night
