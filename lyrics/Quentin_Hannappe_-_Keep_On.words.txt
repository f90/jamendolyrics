keep
on
working
on
your
dreams
and
don't
run
away
keep
on
following
your
dreams
and
don't
go
astray
we
searching
everywhere
for
the
peace
of
mind
it's
already
there
but
we
can
not
find
i
keep
struggling
for
my
life
but
i'm
a
strong
man
today
i
keep
fighting
for
my
rights
so
much
songs
to
play
so
many
problems
so
many
close
friends
and
when
it's
gonna
rain
how
many
gonna
stand
so
many
problems
so
many
close
friends
and
when
it's
gonna
rain
how
many
gonna
stand
keep
on
working
on
your
dreams
and
don't
runaway
keep
on
following
your
dreams
and
don't
go
astray
sit
back
and
watch
what
happens
those
days
how
can
i
relax
for
the
children
of
today
we're
smart
enough
to
find
our
own
line
we
make
art
and
stuff
but
they
just
stay
blind
so
many
problems
so
many
close
friends
and
when
it's
gonna
rain
how
many
gonna
stand
so
many
problems
so
many
close
friends
and
when
it's
gonna
rain
how
many
gonna
stand
