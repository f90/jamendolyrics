lay
awake
at
night
wondering
how
could
i
let
it
get
this
way
through
all
the
pain
i
took
all
the
blame
while
you
cursed
my
last
name
i
thought
we
could
get
better
stayed
committed
like
a
soldier
believed
we're
okay
now
i
know
that
you
don't
care
at
all
time
wasted
gave
all
of
my
soul
and
my
heart
to
someone
that
would
never
give
me
the
same
i
was
a
fool
to
believe
that
you
would
finally
be
the
one
to
give
me
the
same
heartbroken
now
how
you
let
me
down
but
somehow
deep
down
i
still
do
love
you
now
your
out
all
night
telling
your
lies
about
the
way
i
hurt
you
they
couldn't
see
the
way
you
made
me
feel
ashamed
for
choosing
to
love
you
i
began
to
see
clearer
that
you
were
just
a
liar
stuck
in
your
ways
so
now
i
choose
to
walk
away
forever
time
wasted
gave
all
of
my
soul
and
my
heart
to
someone
that
would
never
give
me
the
same
i
was
a
fool
to
believe
that
you
would
finally
be
the
one
to
give
me
the
same
heartbroken
now
how
you
let
me
down
but
somehow
deep
down
i
still
do
love
you
how
could
you
just
throw
it
all
away
babe
how
could
you
throw
it
all
away
i
stayed
with
you
through
all
the
lies
and
pain
through
all
the
lies
and
pain
oh
tears
roll
down
my
eyes
tears
roll
down
my
eyes
as
i
now
realize
your
love
was
never
truly
mine
at
all
time
wasted
gave
all
of
my
soul
and
my
heart
to
someone
that
would
never
give
me
the
same
i
was
a
fool
to
believe
that
you
you
would
finally
be
the
one
too
give
me
the
same
heartbroken
now
heartbroken
now
how
you
let
me
down
oh
but
somehow
how
deep
down
i
still
do
love
you
