the sun is fading under blood red sky
the reign of day is over
night soon will break free
they wake in the eerie glow of moonlight
forgotten souls beyond our sight

world that's gone forever
long ago lost in their
eyes that shine with mystery
last remaining shadows
of lost time
whisper in the moonlight

surprised you're waking in the morning
can't understand your feelings
and where d'you get these thoughts
inside your mind the voice is calling
for the night to rise at your side

world that's gone forever
long ago lost in their
eyes that shine with mystery
last remaining shadows
of lost time
whisper in the moonlight

so hear their voice
sharing their yearning
gift they're giving to you
hear their voice
sharing their memories
sacred secrets from past time

world that's gone forever
long ago lost in their
eyes that shine with mystery
last remaining shadows
of lost time
whisper in the moonlight

so hear their voice
sharing their yearning
gift they're giving to you
hear their voice
sharing their memories
sacred secrets from past

so hear their voice
sharing their yearning
gift they're giving to you
hear their voice
sharing their memories
sacred secrets from past time
