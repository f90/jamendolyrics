now that i have found you i'm okay
but the people that surround you act strange
will we ever fold up don't say
maybe just a heads up is ok

when i am in focus i seem blind
i can barely notice the time
who can i believe in if not you
you're the only reason i'm true


aw ah aw
ah aw
aw ah aw ah
aw ah aw aw ah

i've thought enough
should i turn this around
is this a bluff
should i really make a sound
am i alright
or am i steering out of sight

aw ah aw ah aw aw ah
aw ah aw ah aw aw ah
