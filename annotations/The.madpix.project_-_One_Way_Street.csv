14.57,17.96,Tears are like diamonds in my eyes
17.96,21.0,Blind me so now you’re out of sight
21.41,26.79,It’s enough it’s too late to break this silence
28.26,31.5,In a rose coloured view of us
31.67,35.12,either cause could I realize
35.13,38.4,All your lies would be blades to knifes
38.78,40.72,To stab me inside
40.72,44.15,Who will save you from this dark?
44.15,47.57,Who will fix your selfish heart?
47.57,50.78,A one way street  that’s how you live
50.78,54.44,Why do you always take and never give?
83.11,86.16,Wide awake  yeah I’ve crossed the line
86.16,87.19,I’m coming home
87.19,89.96,I’m running back to real life
89.96,90.91,Through the start
90.91,94.51,Where I could breathin‘ freely baby
95.74,97.73,Can’t you see we ran off time
97.92,102.01,Chasing happiness while you get what you need
102.8,106.3,There’s nothing left of us but bleeding blades and knifes
106.3,109.07,Tonight you‘ll know how it feels
109.07,112.5,A one way street  that’s how you live
112.5,115.92,Why do you always take and never give?
115.92,119.14,I’ll walk away to help you see
119.36,122.78,Our love is rolling down so easily
122.78,124.72,A one way street
155.14,156.92,A one way street
158.12,160.54,You never give
161.56,164.02,I’ll walk away
165.01,167.56,So easily
167.39,169.43,A one way street
