13.1,14.73,Maybe you hate me
15.75,18.33,but you dress somebody's suit
19.15,21.36,because there's no risk
22.21,23.22,to put on a mask
25.47,31.32,when we get scared to live
31.98,39.01,with our back  with our back
39.01,40.87,Maybe you love me
41.69,44.95,but you run under the sun and me under the rain
44.95,47.54,it's so easy
48.14,50.78,to lose ourselves
51.41,57.25,when we get scared to love
57.89,64.15,with every tear with every fear
64.36,67.39,But you could give me just your money
67.63,70.64,but I wished just your honey
70.09,74.1,I burnt your t-shirt  that one with bunny
74.1,78.77,and now about you nothing more of funny
84.45,86.88,Maybe we'll meet again
87.1,90.36,but this not the right life for us
90.46,93.37,it's so hard
93.58,96.18,to live our love
96.81,101.87,when we get scared to see
103.33,109.15,inside our soul inside our soul
109.8,112.82,But you could give me just your money
113.06,116.07,but I wished just your honey
115.54,119.33,I burnt your t-shirt  that one with bunny
119.55,123.21,and now about you nothing more of funny
123.21,126.06,Your mind is closed like an aquarium
126.06,129.46,mine completly opened like the Colosseum
129.55,132.49,so nothing about idyll between us
132.49,141.21,it's not a wrong accentÂ no no no no no no no no
141.41,145.26,what's wrong is the concept
145.49,148.9,wrong concept to love
148.79,151.98,But you could give me just your money
151.98,154.87,but I wished just your honey
154.84,158.14,I burnt your t-shirt  that one with bunny
158.44,162.07,and now about you nothing more of funny
162.04,164.72,you could give me just your money
164.95,167.8,but I wished just your honey
167.8,171.2,I burnt your t-shirt  that one with bunny
171.46,177.92,and now about you nothing more of funny
177.92,180.11,Wrong concept  wrong concept to love
181.19,192.7,wrong concept to love  to love  wrong concept.
