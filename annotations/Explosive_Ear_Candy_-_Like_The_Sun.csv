15.64,18.93,I see your face everywhere that I go
18.93,20.62,On the clouds in the sky
20.63,22.67,On the faces of strangers
22.68,24.36,The birds sing your name
24.36,26.21,And the fish try to talk

32.35,33.75,You're so far away
33.78,35.6,But your light shines on
36.12,37.51,And brightens each day

78.75,80.79,For my own selfish reasons
81.01,82.46,You paint my sky blue
82.46,84.26,And you spin my earth 'round
84.26,86.19,So don't leave me alone
86.19,88.59,'Cause I can't stand to miss you.
88.59,90.17,You're like the sun
90.48,91.88,You're so far away
91.88,93.78,But your light shines on
94.21,95.63,And brightens each day
95.63,97.67,When you're not around
97.96,101.26,You make it worthwhile to expect you.
101.41,103.29,You're like the sun
103.59,107.03,You turn on a switch and the gloom is gone
