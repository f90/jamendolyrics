13.6990104162,17.34,someday you'll come back here
19.5887051812,22.8,and you'll open up your arms
25.6086235529,31.28,you'll laugh and say i knew it wouldn't take you long
31.9245750435,34.42,to realize i was gone
37.7883682387,41.54,it's only been years
43.6785576641,46.52,but for me it's been so long
49.6228473719,53.34,i remember it like yesterday
53.5155076904,55.14,oh you could say
55.615039799,57.92,i've been holding on
60.3712205955,64.48,i've waited all of my life
64.8428851008,67.38,for you to make it right
67.5184764089,70.5,but the time has come and gone
72.2312951548,76.39,it's faded and lost all it's light
76.7921435155,79.77,a star that shined so bright
79.9401203094,82.2,falls from the sky
84.1399423048,88.02,don't make a wish that won't come true
88.572410622,91.28,i learned that from you
91.6142842681,94.21,such a long time ago
95.9885342107,100.39,when you left you said you had to find
100.7185501751,103.6383365282,a better way of life
103.6383365282,106.2,this one just wouldn't do
108.1287277623,112.45,i've waited all of my life
112.8104207462,115.01,for you to take your time
115.6108997078,119.14,to find your place
120.0633593573,123.3306488125,but i learned that this world still turns without you
123.3306488125,126.4,and you were just a phase and i learned without you
126.5149296108,130.39,here i was happier alone
130.6335572718,133.39,then i ever would've known
156.1899991304,159.27,i've waited i've waited
162.1209291621,166.96,i've waited i've waited i've waited
168.427081516,172.78,i've waited all of my my life
172.792727853,175.4488612401,for you to take your time
175.4488612401,178.39,but the time has come and gone
180.1647658586,184.58,it's faded and lost all it's light
184.8490957632,188.0,a star that shined so bright
188.0319835385,190.39,falls from the sky
190.6969331942,195.8,on this cold december night
