18.4456743032,22.452244898,he's a whistler when the wind blows
22.6290457787,26.801632653,keeps it simple only whole notes
27.7849457995,33.737142857,plays his hollow tune effortlessly
35.5750533422,39.595102041,he just sits there in limbo
39.8567780168,44.212244898,doesn't listen full of blow holes
44.9461338512,52.496190476,curtains waver the old refrain repeats
53.8258247029,56.809795918,a penny for a thought
57.5541883216,61.090612245,for pounds of flesh he's bought
61.8476991709,69.093877551,a peso for what not to confess here
70.3625524015,74.266122449,the last shall be the first
74.9153608248,78.213877551,wordlessly coerced
79.2688286381,86.455510204,death is not the worst atrocity
87.0246909926,90.987755102,there's a hissing through the window
91.3361481816,95.389387755,like a twisted virtuoso
96.2820789984,102.386938776,warning of a storm brewing again
104.1485000765,108.179591837,to the victor goes the intro
108.3689607085,112.656326531,full of whispered innuendo
113.4497354037,121.115283447,time once more for a paranoid crusade
138.9048853004,142.824489796,the past shall be reversed
143.3032853977,147.11292517,the dead not so accursed
147.5718351139,154.644897959,a universe rehearsed in tragedy
155.5876554966,159.547936508,he's a whistler he's a widow
159.8503118816,163.966984127,doesn't miss her plays it solo
164.9491476162,171.240634921,blissfully ignoring his instinct
172.8037495982,176.690793651,tears bitter on the pillow
176.9745681317,181.546666667,makes his mission not to know more
182.1740062152,189.724444444,curtains flutter the old refrain repeats
191.7206612569,198.948571429,yeah he's a widow
207.08952845,211.2,he's a whistler
211.378147904,215.725714286,he's a whistler
216.5143660188,224.75755102,oh
