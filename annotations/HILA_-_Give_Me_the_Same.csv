18.57,19.97,Lay awake at night
20.8,22.19,Wondering how could I
23.02,24.41,Let it get this way
27.46,28.85,Through all the pain
29.5,31.07,I took all the blame
31.9,33.58,While you cursed my last name
36.2,38.16,I thought we could get better
38.45,39.97,Stayed committed like a soldier
40.94,42.6,Believed we're okay
44.41,52.36,Now I know that you don't care at all
53.53,55.22,Time wasted
55.22,61.06,Gave all of my soul and my heart to someone that would never
61.06,62.19,Give me the same
62.19,69.94,I was a fool to believe that you would finally be the one to
69.95,71.29,Give me the same
71.29,74.97,Heartbroken now
75.7,78.85,How you let me down
79.69,85.24,But somehow deep down I still do
86.08,88.48,Love you
91.79,93.22,Now your out all night
94.4,95.45,Telling your lies
96.33,97.75,About the way I hurt you
98.45,99.97,They couldn't see the way
100.64,102.19,You made me feel ashamed
102.97,105.24,For choosing to love you
107.44,109.27,I began to see clearer
109.83,111.06,That you were just a liar
111.91,113.9,Stuck in your ways
115.25,124.62,So now I choose to walk away forever
124.63,126.33,Time wasted
126.34,132.18,Gave all of my soul and my heart to someone that would never
132.18,133.3,Give me the same
133.45,141.06,I was a fool to believe that you would finally be the one to
141.06,142.18,Give me the same
142.41,146.34,Heartbroken now
146.82,150.8,How you let me down
150.8,156.35,But somehow deep down I still do
157.18,159.21,Love you
160.56,166.99,How could you just throw it all away babe
166.99,168.87,How could you throw it all away
169.15,173.81,I stayed with you through all the lies and pain
173.81,177.75,Through all the lies and pain oh
177.94,181.39,Tears roll down my eyes
180.93,183.56,Tears roll down my eyes
182.56,184.69,As I now realize
186.44,192.68,Your love was never truly mine
192.68,195.76,At all
195.76,197.46,Time wasted
197.46,203.29,Gave all of my soul and my heart to someone that would never
203.29,204.74,Give me the same
204.74,212.18,I was a fool to believe that you (you) would finally (be the one too)
212.18,213.53,Give me the same
213.53,215.79,Heartbroken now
216.07,218.53,Heartbroken now
218.04,220.79,How you let me down
220.8,221.91,Oh
221.91,227.74,But somehow (how)  deep down I still do
227.74,229.74,Love you
