22.76,26.92,I’m asleep at the wheel and there’s a curve in the highway
30.15,34.3,Yet we tear through the night like a peyote migraine
36.94,44.46,How much further is it  aching  so exquisite
44.87,49.07,I hope we can stop in time
52.31,56.69,Now you don’t want to dance  'cause we’re looking right through you
57.84,64.31,Oh oh  and the clothes that you wear  we don’t mean to stare
74.46,78.61,Now the sky is on fire and the desert is freezing
81.83,86.0,Wonder how I’m alive  hen I’m not even breathing
88.64,96.16,How much further is it  aching  so exquisite
96.57,100.76,I hope we can stop in time
103.98,109.08,Now you don’t want to dance  'cause we’re looking right through you
109.54,116.47,Oh oh and the clothes that you wear we don’t mean to stare
116.93,123.39,Oh oh  but the people you know  they say what they want to
123.39,131.24,Oh oh  'cause the truth of it is  we don’t really care
