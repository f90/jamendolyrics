51.16,55.56,Now that I have found you I’m okay
57.13,62.37,But the people that surround you act strange
63.97,68.37,Will we ever fold up don’t say
70.36,75.17,Maybe just a heads up is ok
89.61,93.96,When I am in focus I seem blind
95.96,100.37,I can barely notice the time
102.26,106.78,Who can I believe in if not you
108.74,113.17,You’re the only reason I’m true
115.08,126.21,Aw ah aw ah aw aw ah
127.98,138.99,Aw ah aw ah aw aw ah
141.92,145.01,I’ve thought enough
145.01,147.96,Should I turn this around
148.32,151.45,Is this a bluff
151.45,154.33,Should I really make a sound
154.71,157.36,Am I alright
157.9,161.16,Or am I steering out of sight
172.74,183.78,Aw ah aw ah aw aw ah
185.59,190.18,Aw ah aw ah aw aw ah
